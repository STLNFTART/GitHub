Primal Logic: Integrated Simulation Design
Framework
Next-Gen Algorithmic Infrastructure for Autonomous Systems, Defense, and Finance
Problem Statement
• Current simulations (Carla, PyBullet, etc.) are fragmented, domain-limited.
• Investors and agencies require scalable, reproducible, high-fidelity models.
• Gaps in multi-sector integration: defense, finance, mobility, energy.
Solution
• Unified simulation stack embedding proprietary Primal Logic algorithms.
• Modular: physics engines, temporal processors, swarm controllers.
• Cross-domain: drones, vehicles, cryptographic trading, BCI/IoT.
Core Technology
• Proprietary equations (∆x(t), Θ(τ), λ-optimization, recursive intent).
• Integration with existing engines (Carla, PyBullet, Unity).
• Quantum-resistant cryptographic kernel for secure telemetry.
• Metrics: reproducibility, scalability, adaptive weighting.
